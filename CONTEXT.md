# Domain glossary

## Admin

An authenticated person who creates, edits, publishes, and shares Forms and can inspect every Submission. Admin includes the form-designer responsibility; there is no separate Designer role.

## User

An authenticated person who fills Forms and can inspect only their own Drafts and Submissions.

## Form

A shareable questionnaire-like document owned by the application. A Form has a title, description, Template Draft, optional Published Template, and one stable share link.

## Template Draft

The editable document an Admin is currently preparing. Saving it does not change the document available through the Form's share link.

## Published Template

The current document used to start new Responses. Publishing replaces the previous Published Template and invalidates every unsubmitted Draft for that Form. Published Templates have no user-visible history.

## Field

A tagged content control within a Form document. Its tag is its stable identity in prefill data and extracted JSON. Field tags must be present and unique within a Form.

## Response

A User's single attempt to fill a Form. A User can have at most one Response for a Form. A Response may hold a Draft and may produce one Submission.

## Draft

A manually saved, resumable Response state containing both the current document and its extracted field data. A Draft is not complete unless both representations were saved successfully.

## Submission

The immutable completed result of a Response. A Submission consists of extracted field data, a filled DOCX, and a PDF. It exists only when all three artifacts were persisted successfully.

## Operation

A tracked asynchronous request to save a Template Draft, publish a Form, save a Draft, or submit a Response. An Operation progresses through pending, processing, completed, or failed and correlates ONLYOFFICE callbacks with the initiating action.

## Prefill

A snapshot of application-provided Field values and editability policies applied when a Response starts. Resume does not refresh Prefill; starting again after draft invalidation does.
